# Payment and shipping

From Litium version 8 all payment and shipping providers are set up as separate [Litium Apps](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps).

To be able to place orders in your site you will need to configure a payment provider and a shipping provider.

**A heads up before you start:**

Litium apps are single install only, when you have installed your app once that apps install-link will not work again. If needed just follow the steps below to clear the app for re-installation:

1. Stop the container of the app you want to clear
1. Open the folder where you kepp the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the docker-task
1. In the `/data`-subfolder of that folder you will find a `direct-payment` and a `direct-shipment` folder, delete the one you want to clear
1. Start the container again and the install link will work

## Prepare

Download `direct-payment-config.json` and `direct-shipment-config.json` from the [_Resources_-folder](Resources) to your computer.

## Add payments

An app container for [Direct payment](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps/direct-payment) was created earlier when you did the [Docker task](../Docker).

Follow these steps to create and configure the app:

1. To create the app just navigate to the Direct payment app at https://localhost:10011, this will open the installation view in backoffice of your Litium application:
