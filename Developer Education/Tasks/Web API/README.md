# Web API

> To do this task you first need to complete the task [Author service](../Author%20service)

Your client has resellers that need to access information about books for specific authors through a REST API. you need to provide an API to access your [Author service](../Author%20service).

See Litium docs for a [API controller sample](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/architecture/web-api) which is similar to the controller you will be creating here.

1. Create a new ViewModel that the API should return

    ```C#
    public class AuthorApiViewModel
    {
        public List<string> Books { get; set; }
    }
    ```

1. Create the class `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc.Controllers.Api.AuthorApiController` that inherit from `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc.Controllers.Api.ApiControllerBase`
    1. Decorate it with `[Route("api/authors")]`
1. Add the method `GetAuthor(Guid authorPageId)`
    1. Decorate it with `[Route("author")]`
1. Inject `IAuthorService` in your controllers constructor and use it to get and return a `AuthorApiViewModel` loaded with all books for the provided id
1. A finished `AuthorApiController`-example can be found in the [_Resources_-folder](Resources/AuthorApiController.cs)

## Try it out

1. Get the systemid for your author page (the easiest way is to open the page in Litium backoffice, then the id is showing in the url-field)
1. You should be able to reach your API at _[your site domain]/api/authors/author?authorPageId=[Your author page id]_

A common problem is that test string and not a valid `Guid` is used when testing which gives a 404 when you try to call the API.

## Optional extra tasks

### Swagger

When you inherited `ApiControllerBase` you got the class decorator `[ApiCollection("site")]` from the  base-class, this decorator includes your controller in Litiums Swagger documentation.

Verify that your API is now part of the Swagger-documentation:

1. Navigate to `http://[domain]/litium/swagger`
1. Select _Accelerator Web API_ in the top drop-down list
1. Verify that _Author api_ is listed with your method

### Secure the API

You need to protect access to your API, for information read sections on _Security_ and _Authorization_ on the Docs-link above

1. Decorate your controller with `[Litium.Web.WebApi.OnlyJwtAuthorization]`
1. Try accessing your API again and note that your are now getting a **401 Unauthorized** error
1. Create a service account in _Litium Backoffice > Control panel > System settings > Service accounts_
1. Use postman to get a JWT token and pass the token in your API-call, instructions on how to do this can be [found on docs](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/architecture/web-api).
