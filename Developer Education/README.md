# Litium Developer Education

**We have moved!**

This used to be the starting point of the Litium Developer Education but from now on you can find all the material in a new format at [start.litium.dev](https://start.litium.dev/). The new [start.litium.dev](https://start.litium.dev/)-site has all the material that used to be here but structured in a format more appropriate for self study, so head over there and give it a try.

If you still want to use the material that used to be here just select the [litium-8](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/tree/litium-8/Developer%20Education)-branch where everything is still available.
