# Litium Developer Education

The developer education can be done as a self study course or by attending scheduled or on-demand classroom training.

The scheduled classroom training is avaliable at [litium.se](https://www.litium.se/utbildning).

All tasks are tested in Windows only, Litium currently do not give support or training when doing the education using a non Windows environment.

## Self study - Getting started

Go through the [edcucation slides](https://litiumdev-slides.svc.litiumlab.se) (the slides are hosted [here on GitHub](./Presentation) so if you find anything that needs to be fixed please create an Issue or submit a pull request).

Do the development tasks below when they are referenced in the slides and if you have questions please ask them in [Litium forum](https://forum.litium.com/).

### Development tasks

To practice what you learn from the slides you can do these tasks to create a simple bookstore.

Before you start with the tasks make sure that you have gone through [Litium system requirements](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/system-requirements).

Some tasks assume that a previous task has been completed (task dependencies are presented in each tasks README-file), the recommended order to do them are:

1. [Developer certificate](./Tasks/Developer%20certificate)
1. [Docker](./Tasks/Docker)
1. [Installation](./Tasks/Installation)
1. [Litium search](./Tasks/Litium%20search)
